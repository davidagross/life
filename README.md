life
====

an extremely shorthand version of the Conway's game of life modeled after APL

background
----------

I was delighted to find a video [1] in which the program for Conways Game of Life [2] 
was prepared in a quite bueatiful shorthand.  While APL's array-based language is quite
different from my native, high-level MATLAB, I was intrigued as to the compressibility
of Life in this language.

This code provides some of the comparable MATLAB walkthrough as well as the final program
in the shortest possible sense, if the function names were single characters.

The comparison isn't fair, and is relatively meaningless in a technical sense.  However,
it lends great persepctive as to the distance that higher level languages are from their
mathematical intentions.
